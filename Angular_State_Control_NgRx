NgRx is Angular implementation of Redux

Actions
=========
Action has an identifier and the payload

Reducer checks for the kind of action that is to be executed
Reducer copies the data and then updates them
The Reducer returns a new State.
This State is forwarded to Application Store
So the State is changed immutably (the old state is not touched. The old State is copied and edited)
Then the old State is overwritten by the new State
